# Arash Heidari

<b>Hi, I'm Arash</b>. I have a Master's Degree in Digital Electronics Systems and graduated as the best student of the year in my field of study from Iran University of Science and Technology, where I have obtained my Bachelor's as well.

Currently, I am looking for an interesting PhD position. My last experience was working at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) as an AI-researcher. My main responsibility as an AI-Researcher was to carry out AI-based projects (mostly Computer Vision tasks) with the collaboration of PhD and Masters Student. Teaching Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms and Frameworks is also one of my duties. I also have the experience to work as an English translator, which sharpened my English skills.

Machine Learning is my main speciality. I studied machine learning algorithms in the last few years to become a master in this area. Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, GANs, Explainable AI, and Natural Language Processing are the main topics I studied about. I have the experience to work with both TensorFlow (and of course Keras API) and PyTorch frameworks as well. You can find out more about my skills in the Skills section on my [personal website](https://heidariarash.github.io).

Furthermore, one of my interests is programming. I have an excellent command of some of the programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C/C++, etc. My field of interest in the programming domain, other than embedded software development, is GUI Design and Web Development.

I have many hobbies such as watching movies and series, reading books, etc., but learning new skills and gain knowledge about things I love to know about is the most valuable hobby I have. I love to read books about physics, genetics, and history. Playing sports such as Football (or as Americans say soccer) is another hobby I enjoy. Apart from all of these, I am a good team-player, a fast learner, and an energetic person.
